# Identity Management Systems: Decentralized Identity Fabric
Unlocking Fine-Grained Access Control with Self-Sovereign Blockchain-Agnostic Permissioned Key Management Protocols

Decentralized Identity Management Systems is a cutting-edge solution designed to orchestrate fine-grained access control via self-sovereign blockchain-agnostic permissioned key management protocols. This repository provides a comprehensive framework for managing identities, permissions, and access control in various ecosystems. By leveraging blockchain-agnostic protocols, Identity Management Systems offers unparalleled flexibility, scalability, and security for a wide range of use cases.

In today's digital landscape, identity management has become a critical concern. Traditional centralized systems are often vulnerable to single points of failure, data breaches, and security threats. Identity Management Systems addresses these concerns by providing a decentralized, trustless, and permissioned architecture that empowers individuals and organizations to take control of their digital identities.

The system's fine-grained access control mechanism ensures that users have complete sovereignty over their personal data, allowing them to selectively disclose information to trusted parties. This approach mitigates the risks associated with data breaches and unauthorized access. Furthermore, the permissioned key management protocol ensures that access is granted only to authorized entities, thereby preventing unauthorized access and data tampering.

By utilizing blockchain-agnostic protocols, Identity Management Systems can seamlessly integrate with various blockchain networks, enabling interoperability and ensuring that the system remains future-proof. This flexibility also allows the system to adapt to emerging technologies and use cases, making it an ideal solution for a wide range of industries and applications.

## Key Features
- Decentralized Identity Fabric: Self-sovereign identity management enables individuals and organizations to control their digital identities and manage access permissions.
- Fine-Grained Access Control: Granular permission management ensures that users have complete control over their personal data and can selectively disclose information to trusted parties.
- Blockchain-Agnostic: The system's permissioned key management protocol is designed to be blockchain-agnostic, allowing for seamless integration with various blockchain networks.
- Permissioned Key Management: Access is granted only to authorized entities, preventing unauthorized access and data tampering.
- Interoperability: The system's modular architecture enables easy integration with various systems, applications, and industries.

## Technology Stack
- TypeScript: The primary programming language used for developing the system's core components.
- Node.js: The Node.js runtime environment provides a scalable and efficient platform for the system's backend infrastructure.
- PostgreSQL: A robust relational database management system used for storing and managing identity data.
- GraphQL: A query language for APIs used for building the system's API gateway and data access layer.
- Docker: Containerization technology used for deploying and managing the system's components.

## Installation
To install and set up Identity Management Systems, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using the command `git clone https://github.com/ewhu/IdentitymanagementSystems.git`.
2. Install Node.js and Docker on your system.
3. Install the required dependencies using the command `npm install`.
4. Configure the PostgreSQL database and update the environment variables accordingly.
5. Build the Docker images using the command `docker-compose build`.
6. Start the system using the command `docker-compose up`.

## Configuration
The system requires the following environment variables to be set:

- `DATABASE_URL`: The URL of the PostgreSQL database.
- `GRAPHQL_API_KEY`: The API key for the GraphQL API gateway.
- `NODE_ENV`: The environment variable specifying the system's runtime environment (development, staging, or production).

## Usage
Once the system is set up, you can interact with it using the GraphQL API gateway. The API documentation is available at `<http://localhost:4000/graphql>`.
